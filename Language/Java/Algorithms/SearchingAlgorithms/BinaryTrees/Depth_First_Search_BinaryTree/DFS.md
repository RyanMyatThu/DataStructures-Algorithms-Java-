# Depth First Search (DFS) To Traverse Binary Trees
---

## What is Depth First Search?
The `Depth First Search` algorithm is used to recursively traverse through the binary tree in a certain order. It can be used to traverse either **graphs** or **trees**. The strategy is to go "deep" into a structure before retracing steps to explore alternative paths. DFS can be implemented using both recursion (implicitly using a call stack) or iteration (using an explicit **stack**).

#### Types of DFS

- Pre-order Traversal
- Post-order Traversal
- In-order Traversal

### Uses of DFS

DFS is commonly used in:

1. Tree traversals (Pre-order, In-order, Post-order)
2. Pathfinding algorithms
3. Solving puzzles, such as mazes
4. Cycle detection in graphs
5. Topological sorting
6. Connected component detection in graphs
